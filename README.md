# Data for the Research of Wireless Performance of Sub-1 GHz Networks

Presented here is a dataset used for our research of Wireless Performance of Sub-1 GHz Networks. The dataset was recorded using the experimental setups described in "Factors Affecting the Performance of Sub-1 GHz IoT Wireless". The purpose of our testbed was to explore the influence of practical environments and provide a checklist of potential factors affecting wireless network performance in realistic environments.
